# Important Notice

This project is going to be discontinued because a new Syphon plugin ([KlakSyphon]) has been released that provides a superset of the features in Funnel. Please consider migrating to the new plugin.

Funnel
======

![Screenshot][Screenshot]

*Funnel* is a Syphon server plugin for [Unity][Unity]. It allows Unity to share
rendered frames with other applications that supports the [Syphon][Syphon]
protocol (e.g., [MadMapper][MadMapper], [VDMX][VDMX]) without introducing any
performance loss.

Compatibility Note
------------------

This version is redesigned and optimized for [the new OpenGL backend (OpenGL
Core)][GLCore] and not compatible with the legacy OpenGL backend. If it's
required to support legacy OpenGL, use [the legacy version][Legacy] instead.

System Requirements
-------------------

- Mac OS X 10.8 or later
- Unity 5.3 or later

This version only supports the 64-bit runtime and the OpenGL Core API mode.
[The legacy version][Legacy] is available for legacy setups.

Setting Up
----------

- Download and import [the plugin package][Package].
- Add the Funnel script to a camera that's to be shared.

That's all! It automatically sets up a Syphon server and starts publishing
rendered frames towards Syphon client applications.

The name of the Syphon server is set in the following manner:

    [Process Name]-[Game Object Name]

It's useful to identify the server on the client side.

Properties
----------

**Screen Width/Height, Anti Aliasing** - Configures the screen to be sent.

**Discard Alpha** - Clears the alpha channel with 1.0 (completely opaque)
before sending.

**Render Mode** - Determines how the frame is shared.
 - Send Only - Sends the frame and doesn't keep it. The rendered frame is only
   available on the client side.
 - Render To Target - Sends the frame and copies it to the render texture.
 - Preview On Game View - Sends the frame and display it on the Game view.
